# CA266 - Probability & Statistics
This assignment is based on a system consisting of several components in series and in parallel.

Using R I have created a program which can return:  
Part A. The probability of the system working  
Part B. A simulation to estimate the reliability of the system  
Part C. A plot, showing the improved reliability with more iterations
